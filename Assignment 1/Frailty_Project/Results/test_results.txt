Grip Strength:
	Mean: 26 kg
	Range: 19 to 31 kg

The variables correlation matrix presents relationships below the variables:

Height & Weight: Moderate positive correlation (0.57), indicating taller individuals tend to weigh more.
Height & Age: Very weak negative correlation (-0.03), suggesting no significant relationship.
Height & Frailty: Weak positive correlation (0.19) implies that taller individuals may be slightly more likely to be frail.
Weight & Grip Strength: Very weak positive correlation (0.03), suggesting minimal relationship.
Weight & Frailty: Moderate positive correlation (0.54), suggesting heavier individuals might be more prone to frailty.
Age & Grip Strength: Very weak positive correlation (0.13) between age and grip strength. suggests that age alone may not be a strong predictor of grip strength.
Grip Strength & Frailty: There was moderate negative correlation (-0.48) which infers that with reduction of grip strength, the chances for frailty increase.
